## Monprecieuxvelo

This little app called "monprecieuxvelo" was created to learn Laravel. 
I used the CSS framework Bulma.
The application allows you to : 

-  Create members of "monprecieuxvelo" association
-  Manage repairs and parking lots of members
-  Check if members have a pending payment
-  Add and edit repairs
-  Add and edit parking lots
-  ...

## How to run the app

First you have to import the mysql database. You will find the dump.sql file in the source code.
After setting up the Laravel project you can use the following identifiers to test the app : 

-  johnwayne@mpv.fr / RioBravo
-  leevancliff@mpv.fr / laBrute
-  charlesbronson@mpv.fr / harmonica
-  clinteastwood@mpv.fr / blondin

The app was developped with PHP 7.4, Apache 2.4 and MySQL 7.4
