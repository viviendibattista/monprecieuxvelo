## Monprecieuxvelo

This little app called "monprecieuxvelo" was created to learn Laravel. 
I used the CSS framework Bulma.
The application allows you to : 

-  Create members of "monprecieuxvelo" association
-  Manage repairs and parking lots of members
-  Check if members have a pending payment
-  Add and edit repairs
-  Add and edit parking lots
-  ...

## Connect to the database

You will find the dump.sql file in the source code.
After importing the mysql databe you can use the following identifiers to test the app : 

-  johnwayne@mpv.fr / RioBravo
-  leevancliff@mpv.fr / laBrute
-  charlesbronson@mpv.fr / harmonica
-  clinteastwood@mpv.fr / blondin
